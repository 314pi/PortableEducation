   * GNU Lilypond authors

     The pixmaps used to display music is generated from the feta font
     used by GNU Lilypond, copyright Han-Wen Nienhuys, Jan Nieuwenhuizen
     and others. Lilypond is the GNU project music typesetter, if you
     want high quality music typesetting, check it out at
     `http://www.lilypond.org'. Only the generated pixmaps for the font
     are included in GNU Solfege, you should check the source tarball
     for GNU Lilypond for the source code. This because GNU Solfege
     only use a few of the fonts and I had to to some manual tweaking
     to use the fonts. I got permission to do this from Han-Wen
     Nienhuys.

   * Jan Baumgart (Folkwang Universitaet der Kuenste)
