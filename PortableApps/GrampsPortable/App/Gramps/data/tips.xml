<tip number="1"><b>Working with Dates</b><br/>A range of dates can be given by using the format &quot;between January 4, 2000 and March 20, 2003&quot;. You can also indicate the level of confidence in a date and even choose between seven different calendars. Try the button next to the date field in the Events Editor.</tip>

<tip number="2"><b>Editing Objects</b><br/>In most cases double clicking on a name, source, place or media entry will bring up a window to allow you to edit the object. Note that the result can be dependent on context. For example, in the Family View clicking on a parent or child will bring up the Relationship Editor.</tip>

<tip number="3"><b>Adding Images</b><br/>An image can be added to any gallery or the Media View by dragging and dropping it from a file manager or a web browser. Actually you can add any type of file like this, useful for scans of documents and other digital sources.</tip>

<tip number="4"><b>Ordering Children in a Family</b><br/>The birth order of children in a family can be set by using drag and drop. This order is preserved even when they do not have birth dates.</tip>

<tip number="5"><b>Talk to Relatives Before It Is Too Late</b><br/>Your oldest relatives can be your most important source of information. They usually know things about the family that haven't been written down. They might tell you nuggets about people that may one day lead to a new avenue of research. At the very least, you will get to hear some great stories. Don't forget to record the conversations!</tip>

<tip number="7"><b>Filtering People</b><br/>In the People View, you can 'filter' individuals based on many criteria. To define a new filter go to &quot;Edit &gt; Person Filter Editor&quot;. There you can name your filter and add and combine rules using the many preset rules. For example, you can define a filter to find all adopted people in the family tree. People without a birth date mentioned can also be filtered. To get the results save your filter and select it at the bottom of the Filter Sidebar, then click Apply. If the Filter Sidebar is not visible, select View &gt; Filter.</tip>

<tip number="8"><b>Inverted Filtering</b><br/>Filters can easily be reversed by using the 'invert' option. For instance, by inverting the 'People with children' filter you can select all people without children.</tip>

<tip number="9"><b>Locating People</b><br/>By default, each surname in the People View is listed only once. By clicking on the arrow to the left of a name, the list will expand to show all individuals with that last name. To locate any Family Name from a long list, select a Family Name (not a person) and start typing. The view will jump to the first Family Name matching the letters you enter.</tip>

<tip number="10"><b>The Family View</b><br/>The Family View is used to display a typical family unit as two parents and their children.</tip>

<tip number="11"><b>Changing the Active Person</b><br/>Changing the Active Person in views is easy. In the Relationship view just click on anyone. In the Ancestry View doubleclick on the person or right click to select any of their spouses, siblings, children or parents.</tip>

<tip number="12"><b>Who Was Born When?</b><br/>Under &quot;Tools &gt; Analysis and exploration &gt; Compare Individual Events...&quot; you can compare the data of individuals in your database. This is useful, say, if you wish to list the birth dates of everyone in your database. You can use a custom filter to narrow the results.</tip>

<tip number="13"><b>Gramps Tools</b><br/>Gramps comes with a rich set of tools. These allow you to undertake operations such as checking the database for errors and consistency. There are research and analysis tools such as event comparison, finding duplicate people, interactive descendant browser, and many others. All tools can be accessed through the &quot;Tools&quot; menu.</tip>

<tip number="14"><b>Calculating Relationships</b><br/>To check if two people in the database are related (by blood, not marriage) try the tool under &quot;Tools &gt; Utilities &gt; Relationship Calculator...&quot;. The exact relationship as well as all common ancestors are reported.</tip>

<tip number="15"><b>SoundEx can help with family research</b><br/>SoundEx solves a long standing problem in genealogy, how to handle spelling variations. The SoundEx utility takes a surname and generates a simplified form that is equivalent for similar sounding names. Knowing the SoundEx Code for a surname is very helpful for researching Census Data files (microfiche) at a library or other research facility. To get the SoundEx codes for surnames in your database, go to &quot;Tools &gt; Utilities &gt; Generate SoundEx Codes...&quot;.</tip>

<tip number="16"><b>Setting Your Preferences</b><br/>&quot;Edit &gt; Preferences...&quot; lets you modify a number of settings, such as the path to your media files, and allows you to adjust many aspects of the Gramps presentation to your needs. Each separate view can also be configured under &quot;View &gt; Configure View...&quot;</tip>

<tip number="17"><b>Gramps Reports</b><br/>Gramps offers a wide variety of reports. The Graphical Reports and Graphs can present complex relationships easily and the Text Reports are particularly useful if you want to send the results of your family tree to members of the family via email. If you're ready to make a website for your family tree then there's a report for that as well.</tip>

<tip number="18"><b>Starting a New Family Tree</b><br/>A good way to start a new family tree is to enter all the members of the family into the database using the Person View (use &quot;Edit &gt; Add...&quot; or click on the Add a new person button from the People View). Then go to the Relationship View and create relationships between people.</tip>

<tip number="19"><b>What's That For?</b><br/>Unsure what a button does? Simply hold the mouse over a button and a tooltip will appear.</tip>

<tip number="20"><b>Unsure of a Date?</b><br/>If you're unsure about the date an event occurred, Gramps allows you to enter a wide range of date formats based on a guess or an estimate. For instance, &quot;about 1908&quot; is a valid entry for a birth date in Gramps. Click the Date button next to the date field and see the Gramps Manual to learn more.</tip>

<tip number="21"><b>Duplicate Entries</b><br/>&quot;Tools &gt; Database Processing &gt; Find Possible Duplicate People...&quot; allows you to locate (and merge) entries of the same person entered more than once in the database.</tip>

<tip number="22"><b>Merging Entries</b><br/>The function &quot;Edit &gt; Compare and Merge...&quot; allows you to combine separately listed people into one. Select the second entry by holding the Control key as you click. This is very useful for combining two databases with overlapping people, or combining erroneously entered differing names for one individual. This also works for the Places, Sources and Repositories views.</tip>

<tip number="23"><b>Organising the Views</b><br/>Many of the views can present your data as either a hierarchical tree or as a simple list. Each view can also be configured to the way you like it. Have a look to the right of the top toolbar or under the &quot;View&quot; menu.</tip>

<tip number="24"><b>Navigating Back and Forward</b><br/>Gramps maintains a list of previous active objects such as People, Events and . You can move forward and backward through the list using &quot;Go &gt; Forward&quot; and &quot;Go &gt; Back&quot; or the arrow buttons.</tip>

<tip number="25"><b>Keyboard Shortcuts</b><br/>Tired of having to take your hand off the keyboard to use the mouse? Many functions in Gramps have keyboard shortcuts. If one exists for a function it is displayed on the right side of the menu.</tip>

<tip number="26"><b>Read the Manual</b><br/>Don't forget to read the Gramps manual, &quot;Help &gt; User Manual&quot;. The developers have worked hard to make most operations intuitive but the manual is full of information that will make your time spent on genealogy more productive.</tip>

<tip number="27"><b>Adding Children</b><br/>To add children in Gramps there are two options. You can find one of their parents in the Families View and open the family. Then choose to create a new person or add an existing person. You can also add children (or siblings) from inside the Family Editor.</tip>

<tip number="28"><b>Editing the Parent-Child Relationship</b><br/> You can edit the relationship of a child to its parents by double clicking the child in the Family Editor. Relationships can be any of Adopted, Birth, Foster, None, Sponsored, Stepchild and Unknown.</tip>

<tip number="29"><b>Show All Checkbutton</b><br/>When adding an existing person as a spouse, the list of people shown is filtered to display only people who could realistically fit the role (based on dates in the database). In case Gramps is wrong in making this choice, you can override the filter by checking the Show All checkbutton.</tip>

<tip number="60"><b>Record Your Sources</b><br/>Information collected about your family is only as good as the source it came from. Take the time and trouble to record all the details of where the information came from. Whenever possible get a copy of original documents.</tip>

<tip number="61"><b>Directing Your Research</b><br/>Go from what you know to what you do not. Always record everything that is known before making conjectures. Often the facts at hand suggest plenty of direction for more research. Don't waste time looking through thousands of records hoping for a trail when you have other unexplored leads.</tip>

<tip number="62"><b>The 'How and Why' of Your Genealogy</b><br/> Genealogy isn't only about dates and names. It is about people. Be descriptive. Include why things happened, and how descendants might have been shaped by the events they went through. Narratives go a long way in making your family history come alive.</tip>
